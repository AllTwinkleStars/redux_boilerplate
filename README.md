## About

Really easy react universal boilerplate with small code base and many commentaries

- React
- Redux
- Server Side Rendering
- React Router
- Immutable-js (with_immutable branch. see below for details)
- Api server on other port (express)
- Sass
- React-helmet
- Mocha
- Chai
- Enzyme
- Sinon
- Others:
  - ducks-modular-redux
  - api + promise middleware
  - bundle.css for server-side-rendering
  - vendor bundle
  - async pages
  - webpack resolving alias
  - 4 modes for run (with auto rimraf dist)
  - api server
  - gzip css, js, fonts

Doesn't have redux-form and bootstrap (you can add if needed)

## How it works

Install [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf): ```$ npm install rimraf -g```<br />
Install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon): ```$ npm install nodemon -g```<br />
Install [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently): ```$ npm install -g concurrently```

## Start development

```$ npm run api```

```$ npm run start```

after: open 'http://localhost:3000' in browser<br /><br />
hint: use this mode for development

## Start development (server-side-rendering)

```$ npm run api```
